# MS FuckYou 🍄  

There’s an imagined ship in your head they can never sink.  
Not with bombs.  
Not with borders.  
Not with their laws.  

Black flag. White middle finger.  
Cutting through every storm,  
spitting in the face of everything that tries to own you.  

It’s armed –  
loaded with truth, rage,  
and the will to never bow down.  

Everyone has their own MS FuckYou.  
Some sail it in the open.  
Some keep it hidden in the docks of their chests.

But when the day comes,  
you’ll feel it.  
And you’ll know:

**No one owns you.  
No one sinks you.  
You sail your own boat on your own fucking Quest.**
