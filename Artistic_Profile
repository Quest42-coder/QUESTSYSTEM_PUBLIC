This is a consequence.

## Optional Self-description

Maybe just a human with a dog,  
wanting to show the dog the ocean ‚Äì   
living free,  
with no stress, no mindfuck,  
spreading resetboxes,  
writing my name,  
seeing the world with open eyes  
and meeting beautiful humans and dogs along the way.  
Hopefully in an offroad camper.

## System Context

This is not a brand.  
This is not an artist in the classical sense.  

It‚Äôs an origin point.  
A refusal.  

To systems built on destruction.  
To silence.  
To collapse.  

**radically transparent, open source, and not for sale**.

‚ÄûStanding in line, believing the lies?  
You bowing down to the flag,  
you got a bullet in ya head.‚Äú

‚ÄúWenn Arbeit hier nicht Kraft mal Weg ist,  
widerleg es.  
Denn als n√§chstes beweg ich Tr√§ges  
als w√§r es Tetris.‚Äù
