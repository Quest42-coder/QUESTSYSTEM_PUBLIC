# DEVELOPER README ‚Äì QUESTSYSTEM (STATIC CORE FORK MANIFEST)  
**For forkers, rebuilders, hackers, artists, dissidents, scientists, and dreamers.**  
**Not a product. Not a platform. Not a brand.**

---

## What this is

This is not an application.  
This is not an innovation project.  
This is not your next social impact startup.

This is a structure ‚Äî a deployable, non-commercial, open-source firewall against systemic violence, exclusion, and digital colonialism.

It is built for collapse.  
For dignity.  
For action when everything else fails.

---

## What is stable (STATIC CORE)

The following components are sealed and must not be altered in any fork:

1. **The 14 Commandments of Humanity**  
   ‚Äì These are non-negotiable ethical rules.  
   ‚Äì They apply to all forks, modules, deployments, and translations.  
   ‚Äì Violating them voids your legitimacy to use this system.

2. **The 42 Module Structure**  
   ‚Äì Three symbolic rings: Existential, Societal, Structural  
   ‚Äì Each module represents a field of human need, interaction, or system response  
   ‚Äì This structure is fixed for coherence, transparency, and global interoperability

3. **Reset Objects**  
   ‚Äì RESETBOX, Dropcards, and offline containers form the physical anchor  
   ‚Äì They are modular, non-branded, open-source units of survival and symbolic clarity

4. **Non-commercial architecture**  
   ‚Äì The system may not be monetized, licensed, branded, sold, or embedded in for-profit logic  
   ‚Äì Commons-based and non-profit usage (e.g. NGOs, gGmbH, community spaces) is explicitly permitted

## What is open

You may and should:

- Translate it into any language  
- Fork the structure for local use  
- Rebuild modules with new examples or region-specific content  
- Modify visual design, delivery format, or cultural encoding  
- Implement it on Raspberry Pi, USB, QR systems, graffiti walls  
- Distribute via sneakernet, handout, radio, or neighborhood mesh

You do not need permission.  
But you are bound by structural ethics.

---

## What you must not do

- Commercialize any part of the system  
- Add monetization layers (ads, tokens, subscriptions)  
- Gate access through platforms, accounts, logins, or payment  
- Attach it to state or corporate control infrastructures  
- Use it as a tool for behavioral control, surveillance, credit scoring, nudging, or data extraction  
- Build power over others using its name, visuals, or structure  

**Any misuse that violates the 14 Commandments of Humanity voids legitimacy.**

---

## Who is this for?

This system is not for consumers.  
It is for people who:

- Create infrastructure under the radar  
- Run autonomous spaces  
- Deploy tech as resistance  
- Build for dignity in broken contexts  
- Live between worlds and languages  
- See truth where others see threat

You don‚Äôt need to believe in it.  
You just need to not corrupt it.

---

## How to fork (ethically)

1. **Clone or download** the full system (HTML, Markdown, Drop)  
2. **Study the STATIC CORE** (14 Commandments + module map)  
3. **Preserve attribution** (CC BY-SA + Dignity Clause)  
4. **Document your changes clearly**  
5. **Maintain transparency and local openness**  
6. **Do not profit**  
7. **Respect the silent parts ‚Äî they exist for a reason**  
8. **Ask before you simplify**

---

## Minimal setup

The smallest possible fork still requires three components:  
1. **RESETBOX** (physical container, Eurobox standard).  
2. **STOP-Card & RESET:LOG** (printed material for instructions and traceability).  
3. **Offline digital layer** (USB stick or Pi with survival and rights content).  

With these three, the system is already functional.

---

## Dignity clause (summary)

You may fork.  
You may rebuild.  
You may remix, print, distribute, host, localize.

But you may not:  
- sell it  
- gate it  
- brand it  
- extract from it

This is not software.  
This is an ethical construct.  

Violation of the dignity clause or the 14 Commandments disqualifies your fork.

## Signature

**Quest42 üçÑ ‚Äì THIS is Art. Prove it wrong.**  
No control. No updates. No central key.  
If it lives ‚Äî it‚Äôs because someone like you built it without breaking it.

## Fork structure recommendation
