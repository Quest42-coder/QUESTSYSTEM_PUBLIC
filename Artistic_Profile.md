## Statement

This is not a concept.  
This is a consequence. 

**THIS is Art.**  

*Prove it wrong.*

## Optional Self-description

Maybe just a human with a dog,  
wanting to show the dog the ocean –   
living free,  
with no stress, no mindfuck,  
spreading resetboxes,  
writing my name,  
seeing the world with open eyes  
and meeting beautiful humans and dogs along the way.  
Hopefully in an offroad camper.

## System Context

This is not a brand.  
This is not an artist in the classical sense.  

It’s an origin point.  
A refusal.  

To systems built on destruction.  
To silence.  
To collapse.  

**radically transparent, open source, and not for sale**.

## Quote

„Standing in line, believing the lies?  
You bowing down to the flag,  
you got a bullet in ya head.“  
– Rage Against The Machine  

“Wenn Arbeit hier nicht Kraft mal Weg ist,  
widerleg es.  
Denn als nächstes beweg ich Träges  
als wär es Tetris.”  
– Ruhrpott AG  

"Ein Fuchs muss tun, was ein Fuchs tun muss"

Yo:  
1UP Berlin  

...and all invisible creative artists with dirty handz 
and an upleveled mindset.  

Punkx not dead.  
HipHop’s not dead.
